Notes:

- Focused on screen adaptability, rather than pixel precision on spacing elements. For example, the elements are spaced differently in the hero section than in the mockup, as the height of that section is based on viewport height. Let me know if pixel precision is more important that flexibility in screen height on this one

- Couldn't find Proxima Nova in the provided assets folder, so I kept the input placeholders and button Archivo

Happy to address these issues if necessary, just let me know.
